        <p> <strong> Tips</strong></p>
        Don’t leave out the lemon zest, that is what gives it the wonderful lemony flavor! <br>
        When you make the lemon glaze for this pound cake don’t add too much liquid. You want the <br>
        glaze to be nice and thick not runny. Start with 1 tbsp lemon juice and 1 tbsp milk <br>
        and add the remaining 1/2 tbsp as needed.

        <p> <strong> Tips</strong></p>
        Whip the egg whites separately, then fold into the batter. <br>
        To get the dark red color you see here, use about 2-3 Tablespoons of <br>
        liquid food coloring or 2 teaspoons gel food coloring. Dye the batter <br>
        until you are pleased with the color. <br>
