    <h3>What is Baking?????</h3>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking">
        <p>Baking, process of cooking by dry heat,
            especially in some kind of oven. <br> It is probably the oldest cooking
            method. Bakery products, which include <br> bread,
            rolls, cookies, pies, pastries, and muffins, are usually
            prepared from <br>
            flour or meal derived from some form of grain.</p>
    </blockquote>

        cookies crisp from ends and chewy in middle or rising
        your cake untill perfection,i <br>
        bet you <del>like</del> <ins>love</ins> baking.</p>
    <h4>Chemistry of Baking</h4>
    Baking soda, baking powder and yeast give baked dough its lightness. <br>
    Baking soda reacts with acids in the dough to make carbon dioxide(CO<sub>2</sub> ), which helps <br>
    the dough to rise. Baking powder, which is baking soda with an additional <br>
    acidic salt, releases carbon dioxide(CO<sub>2</sub> ) twice during the baking process, once when <br>
    it hits water, and again when it reaches a certain temperature in the oven. <br>
    Heat helps baking powder produce tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub> ), which make a <br>
    cake light and fluffy. <br>
